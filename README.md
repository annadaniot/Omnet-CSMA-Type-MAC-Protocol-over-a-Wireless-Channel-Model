# Omnet-CSMA-Type-MAC-Protocol-over-a-Wireless-Channel-Model


# Project Description

In this project we used OMNet++ to investigate the performance of a simple CSMAtype medium access control protocol over a wireless channel model. An overview over the considered system is shown in the system setup file. 

In the system, it has a variable number of transmitter nodes, which sends data packets to a single reciever node over a common and shared wireless channel.
